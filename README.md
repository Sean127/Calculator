- Future Updates    
    - In future, I would like to add more calculation options such as squaring numbers or multiplying by Pi etc.

## Testing 

For testing this programme, it was a simple case of passing it numerous math questions to ensure that all functions were working as intended. I also testes the validation of the code itself.

### ### Validator Testing 

- HTML
    - When passing through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org), I found I had an extra div closing tag. No other errors were present.
- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

- JavaScript
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jshint validator](https://jshint.com/). The following info was provided

        - There are 16 functions in this file.

        - Function with the largest signature take 2 arguments, while the median is 1.

        - Largest function has 10 statements in it, while the median is 2.

        - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 7 while the median is 1.

## Deployment 
 
 The following process was used to deploy the programme via [GitHub](https://github.com/)

 - Navigate to settings, then pages
 - Select main from the branches tab and click save 
 - The page will then be updated to provide you with the link for the webpage
